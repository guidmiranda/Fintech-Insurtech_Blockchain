The goal is to build a Dapp that automates the management of claims of an insurance
company.

The tasks the smart contract is supposed to accomplish are:
• Allow a customer to submit an insurance claim
• Allow the company to perform a Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure
• Allow a customer to ask for approval of the claim
• Allow the company to settle the claim by paying the customer
